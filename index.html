        <p>Alan Turing was a computer pioneer. He is so well known they have a test about testing a machines ability to think named after him,<br> the Turing test. But by far his most important discovery was the Enigma code. His discovery is one of the most cruial and pivotal points<br> in the Second World War. With the help of some information from crytanalysts from Poland and France, Turing and his team were able<br> to crack the Enigma code for the German U-boats, a very feared German submarine. Alan Turing who was a mathematician and logician<br>cracked on of the hardest codes, encrypted code. His discovery helped the Allies in WW2 to avoid German U-boats entirely meaning that<br>rarely any allied ships would be sunk. In other words his discovery allowed for more troops, ammunition and supplies could be transported<br>to the frontlines. Now the "Turing" award is known to be the Nobel Peace prize of computer science. </p>
